<h3>Description</h3>
<p>No doubt about it, grilling was invented to cook tender cuts of meat. Now a days, beef has replaced the leg of wild boar or mammoth steak our ancestors used to feast on, but the pleasure remains the same: everyone loves to sink their teeth into a well-seared, tender and juicy cut of meat with grill marks on the surface.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 tbsp (30 ml) red wine vinegar</li>
    <li>1 tbsp (15 ml) fresh lemon juice</li>
    <li>4 garlic cloves, very finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 tsp (5 ml) each salt and pepper, divided</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp (2 ml) hot pepper flakes</li>
    <li>1 bay leaf</li>
    <li>3 tbsp (45 ml) olive oil</li>
    <li>1/2 cup (125 ml) very finely chopped fresh parsley leaves</li>
    <li>2 rib eye steaks, about 175 g each</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>To make the Chimichurri sauce, stir the vinegar with the lemon juice, garlic, half of the salt and chilli, the hot pepper flakes and bay leaf. Whisk in the olive oil until well combined; stir in the parsley. Let stand for at least 15 minutes; discard the bay leaf.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, pat the steaks dry with a paper towel. Sprinkle the remaining salt and pepper over both sides of each steak.</li>
    <li>urn the grill on. Select the program and press . Lightly grease the cooking plates with cooking spray. Once the purple indicator light has stopped flashing, place the steaks on the grill and close the lid.</li>
    <li>Cook until the indicator light has changed to the color of desired level of cooking; yellow for rare, orange for medium or red for well done. Transfer the steaks to a plate and cover with foil. Rest for 5 minutes. Serve the steaks with the chimichurri sauce on the side or drizzled over the top.</li>
</ol>
