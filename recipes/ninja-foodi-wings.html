<h3>Description</h3>
<p> These finger-lickin' Ninja Foodi Chicken Wings with Sweet and Sticky Sauce are so dang tasty! I cooked the chicken wings in a pressure cooker until tender and crispy, then coated them in a honey garlic sauce made from scratch. They are the perfect party appetizer to serve on game day or holiday gatherings.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1/2 cup water</li>
    <li>2 pounds frozen chicken wings, drums and flats separated</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons canola oil </li>
    <li>2 tablespoons Buffalo sauce</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Pour water into pot. Place wings into the Cook & Crisp™ Basket and place basket in pot. Assemble the pressure lid, making sure the PRESSURE RELEASE valve is in the SEAL position.</li>
    <li>Select PRESSURE and set HIGH. Set time to 5 minutes. Select START/STOP to begin.</li>
    <li>When pressure cooking is complete, quick release the pressure by turning the PRESSURE RELEASE valve to the VENT position. Carefully remove lid when unit has finished releasing pressure.</li>
    <li>Pat wings dry with paper towels and toss with 2 tablespoons oil in the basket.</li>
    <li>Close crisping lid. Select AIR CRISP, set temperature to 390°F, and set time to 15 minutes. Select START/STOP to begin. </li>
    <li>After 7 minutes, open lid, then lift basket and shake wings or toss them with silicone-tipped tongs. Lower basket back into pot and close lid to resume cooking.</li>
    <li>While the wings are cooking, stir together Buffalo sauce and salt in a large mixing bowl.</li>
    <li>When cooking is complete, transfer wings to the bowl with Buffalo sauce and toss to coat. </li>
</ol>
